# BlueStream

BlueStream is a versatile web gateway that provides seamless access to games, apps, and more via an intuitive interface. It features:

- **Home:** A landing page with a blue/purple theme and two animations (a loading spinner and a typewriter effect).
- **Games & Apps:** Lists of external sites that are opened via our built-in redirection (proxy) mechanism.
- **Settings:** A dummy settings page.
- **Proxy Page:** A page that uses a backend API to fetch and display external content.
- **Backend:** A serverless API (in the `/api` folder) that handles fetching external URLs.
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files with dynamic animations and at least 500 lines of CSS in every file.

This project is deployable on Vercel without any terminal commands. Simply push the repository and Vercel will automatically deploy it.
